All tests in this directory are run on a "make check". They are added to the 
build system in the CMakeLists.txt associated with the binary (e.g. sal2.cpp).
Each $file must have an associated $file.options containing *one line* of the
options that will be passed to the binary.

If you add new regressions, or change any old regressions, make sure to run 
cmake again. This is because the regressions are cached and so 'make check' 
will not detect the changes otherwise.
