Error: [Context: simple04, line(17), column(19)]: The left-hand-side of the simple definition cannot be efficiently simplified. This simple definition is a non-deterministic one, that is, it uses the IN operator. You can avoid the problem rewriting your simple definition, and using an auxiliary variable. For instance, the simple definition "x[i] IN {0,2,4,6};" can be encoded as "x[i] = new-var;", where new-var is a new variable, and is defined in the DEFINITION section as "new-var IN {0, 2, 4, 6};".
